Hidden Markov Models

You can run the TUI in bin\BioProgram.jar.  

You have a few options to work with HMMs.
1) A complete TUI system for designing HMMs (either from
   scratch or from the two default models) has been provided.
   Reports can be built and written to file for the different
   decodings.
2) A number of "default" trials have been provided
   which run default conditions.
   ** The actuals testing mechanism for the report is provided
      in this menu.  It automatically saves reports to 
	  default files in /results.
